                      <h2>Satellite</h2>
                       <p>A satellite is a machine which is set into orbit.
                         Bangabandhu Satellite-1 is the first geostationary satellite of Bangladesh. 
                         This satellite was manufactured by Thales Alenia Space and launched on 11 May 2018. 
                         The total cost of the satellite was 248 million US dollars. 
                         Bangladesh entered a new era through launching its own satellite.
                         Bangladesh is the 57th nation in the world to own a satellite.
                        Government has formed a new organization “Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Limited (BCSCL)” for overall management.
                         This satellite will offer video and communications coverage over Bangladesh as well as in India,
                          Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Indonesia. 
                          It will also provide broadband connectivity to rural areas throughout the country.
                           According to officials, we had to spend $14m for satellite connectivity yearly. After the BS-1 launch, it would be unnecessary. 
                           Private TV channel operators and Direct-to-Home (DTH) service providers will be the main consumers of the satellite. 
                           The weather department, as well as the defence sector,
                            will get benefit from the satellite. This satellite will also help telecommunication system during natural disasters.
